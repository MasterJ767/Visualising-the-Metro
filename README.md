Visualising the Metro line in the Unity Engine
==============================================

This visualisation is a unity project, created for my undergraduate dissertation. It is a visualisation of the Tyne and Wear Metro, located in the North East of England, between the stations at Ilford Road and South Gosforth. The visualisaiton was created to help stakeholders in the metro better understand co-simulation models and graphics which have been created for the network in efforts to work on decarbonisation of the metro.

How to Use
-------------

Open the project and press Play. The camera used to navigate the scene has three modes. Press Z and X to switch between these modes. By default the camera is in Free mode where the user has full control over the camera's actions by using W, A, S, D, SPACE and SHIFT to move the camera in the 6 cartisian directions. The user can switch to Static mode where the camera cycles through a series of selected points to watch the simulation take place, left and right clicking with the mouse allows the user to cycle through these points. The final camera mode is a follow mode where the camera is attached to the back of a train as it passes through the scene. Left and right clicking allows the user to switch between the two trains, one which showcases a more agressive drivcing technique and the other a more defensive driving technique.
